# KPV
This depository contains implementation of Kernel Proxy Variable (KPV) approach, the first method suggested in 'Proximal Causal Learning with Kernels: Two-Stage Estimation and Moment Restriction' (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.04544.pdf). 
The code for Proxy Maximum Moment Restriction (PMMR), the second method proposed in the paper can be find at https://github.com/yuchen-zhu/kernel_proxies.
