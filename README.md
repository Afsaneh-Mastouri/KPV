# KPV
This depository contains implementation of Kernel Proxy Variable (KPV) approach, the first method suggested in 'Proximal Causal Learning with Kernels: Two-Stage Estimation and Moment Restriction' (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.04544.pdf). 
The code for Proxy Maximum Moment Restriction (PMMR), the second method proposed in the paper can be find at https://github.com/yuchen-zhu/kernel_proxies.

# How to run the code?
To run the code you need to:
1) copy/download main + utils + cal_alpha 
2) Add path/address of True_Caual_Effect.npz to load #do_cal at line # 66 of main.py
3) Add path/address of Data_Sample.npz to load samples at line # 71 of main.py
